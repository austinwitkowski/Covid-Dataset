# Covid 19 Infection Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project was created to showcase how fast Covid 19 spread and its level of contagion. This dataset looks at Covid cases arounds the world, and is used to identify deaths, vaccinations, and amount of cases all over the world and broken down by country. This is one of the first projects I have completed. It was done using a step-by-step video guide created by Alex the Analyst.
